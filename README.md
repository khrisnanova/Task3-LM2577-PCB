# Boost Converter
## A Boost Converter is a circuit used to step up a DC input voltage to a higher DC output voltage.
## In this circuit, the input voltage 5V is boosted to 12V at the output.

## Key Components
### 1. LM2577 IC:
#### The core of the boost converter, responsible for regulating the voltage conversion process.
### 2.Inductor (L2, 100µH):
#### Stores energy in a magnetic field when the switch inside the LM2577 is active and releases it to boost the voltage when the switch is off.
### 3.Schottky Diode (D2, SS34):
#### Acts as a rectifier to ensure current flows only toward the output, preventing backflow to the inductor.
### 4.Input Capacitor (C1, 0.1µF):
#### Stabilizes the input voltage
### 5.Output Capacitor (C2, 680µF):
#### Stabilizes the output voltage
### 6.Resistor Divider (R2 and RV1):
#### Forms a feedback voltage divider to provide a reference voltage to the FB pin.
#### RV1 (Potentiometer) allows the adjustment of the output voltage by varying the divider ratio.
### 7.Indicator LED (D1):
#### Indicates the circuit is operational and producing output voltage.
## How It Works
### 1.Energy Storage Phase (Switch ON):
#### When the internal switch in the LM2577 is turned ON, current flows from the input voltage source through the inductor (L2).
#### The inductor stores energy in the form of a magnetic field.
#### During this phase, the load is powered by the energy stored in the output capacitor (C2).
### 2.Energy Transfer Phase (Switch OFF):
#### When the switch is turned OFF, the magnetic field in the inductor collapses, releasing the stored energy.
#### The energy from the inductor combines with the input voltage and flows through the diode (D2) to the output capacitor (C2) and the load.
#### This combined energy results in a higher voltage at the output (boost effect).
### 3.Regulation Through Feedback:
#### The output voltage is continuously monitored via the feedback pin (FB).
#### If the output voltage drops below the desired value, the IC increases the switch's ON time (duty cycle).
#### If the output voltage exceeds the desired value, the IC decreases the ON time of the switch.
### 3.Switching Frequency:
#### The internal switch operates at a fixed frequency of 52kHz, meaning it turns ON and OFF 52,000 times per second.
#### The IC dynamically adjusts the ON/OFF ratio (duty cycle) to maintain a stable output voltage.

## Key Features of the PCB
### 1.Compact Dimensions:
#### The PCB design is optimized for a small size, making it ideal for applications where space is limited, such as portable devices or embedded systems.
#### Supports 2A Current:

### 2.The PCB uses 0.7mm trace width for the power lines.
####  a 0.7mm trace can safely carry up to 2A of current while maintaining an acceptable temperature rise.
#### This ensures the circuit can handle the required current without overheating or causing reliability issues.
### 3.Ground Plane for Stability:
#### The PCB features a dedicated ground plane covering a significant portion of the board.
#### Thermal Management: Helps dissipate heat generated by components and traces.
